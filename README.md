# snap_snap
Snap snap is a simple snake game coded fully in JAVA. In this game, a snake moves around a 400x600 frame hunting for its food. The player needs to direct the snake using UP, DOWN , RIGHT LEFT keys to help the snake eat its food. When the snake is able to eat its food, it grows longer as well as its velocity increases. The player's score increases by 1 if he/she is able to direct the snake to eat its food. If the snake's head collides with its body part, the game ends and the final score is displayed.
